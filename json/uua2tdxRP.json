The symptoms become stronger - panels appear out of order, characters begin to simply chant incoherently, primitively. During one attempted story arc, all the characters simply scream in pain for six panels, clawing at themselves. One day there is a strip just of Phillipe, grasping the border of the panel with bloodied flipper, tugging at it, pushing on it, wailing and screaming in primal hate and fear.
